#Please Note When Testing:
#The website is currently live on Heroku: https://on-the-spot-courier-services.herokuapp.com/

#However, due to our team using a free database solution heroku does not connect correctly to the database and does not retrieve data from tables all the time - meaning login doesnt always work, and booking data retrieval doesnt work (however, the website does funcion correctly on a local server (localhost)). This was discussed in the tutorial.
